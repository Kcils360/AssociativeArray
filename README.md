I went to the Wiki fisrt to learn what an associative array was.  I discovered that it is merely a collection of key:value pairs.  They can be implimented super simply by using a hashtable or (in C#) a dictionary.  Given that we were not able to use either of those implimentations, we created our collection out of arrays.  An array of arrays.  Yep.
